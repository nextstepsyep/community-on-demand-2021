# community-on-demand

We are building a product to give students a method of learning important employability skills through a fun interactive platform that will keep them engaged based on the existing card game Community On Demand.

Many students graduate high school without realizing what skills their desired career deem essential. Without a plan, they may waste time and money in the pursuit of their goals.
This product is a mobile app that projects an employability curriculum and its supplemental card game in order to aid individuals in designing, measuring, building, and organizing their employability skill sets in order to utilize these skills to create a business within the game. 
The application will serve as a companion for users to be able to keep track of their progress through the curriculum, as well as provide a way for the users to keep track of what skills they have through the use of a badge reward system.
This product differentiates itself by not only having this as a card game that students can play together without needing physical cards but also as a curriculum/business guide in which schools can choose to incorporate in their classes.
This product differentiates itself from other career-ready games by using a curriculum/business guide through an engaging card game in which schools can choose to incorporate into their classes.
